7. Glue legs of sawhorses into feet.
8. Using the shaping table remove material from center of feet to minimize contact with the ground which adds stability.
9. Cut slots in tenons of stretchers with hand saw for wedges.
10. Assemble stretchers and legs by applying glue to the tenons as well as the tips of the wedges before hammering them into place.
11. Remove extra material of wedges with hand saw.
