4. Remove material with band saw to create slot in top of legs for top rail. Clean up with chisel.
5. Drill holes for dowels in slot in top of legs.
6. Ease edges and create final surface quality on legs and feet with block plane.
7. Glue legs of sawhorses into feet.
8. Using the shaping table remove material from center of feet to minimize contact with the ground which adds stability.
9. Cut slots in tenons of stretchers with hand saw for wedges.
10. Assemble stretchers and legs by applying glue to the tenons as well as the tips of the wedges before hammering them into place.
11. Remove extra material of wedges with hand saw.
