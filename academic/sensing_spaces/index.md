      Burrard Bridge Intervention:

      Traveling along the seawall, one enters into a compressed and dark tunnel with a light-well in the distance. Though dark, the polished brass surface warms the environment and is a signal that this place has significance. The materiality underfoot changes from asphalt to gravel making soft crunching noises drawing attention to movement and pace. Stepping into the light-well, the space opens up completely to the great concrete eve overhead. Sets of concrete stairs lead up to the space of dwelling, the eye is drawn to the archway of the structure now transformed into a doorway to another realm.

      Granville Bridge Intervention:

      A brass rebar cage in the shape of the existing concrete structure supporting the Granville Bridge rests beside the seawall path. At the junction where the concrete structure changes to a massive steel truss, this rebar cage references the monolithic concrete left anchored to the ground. A few of steps lead you from the sea wall path up to the front of the cage which now transforms into a gate. Passing through the gate is a transition in to a different realm.

      Cambie Bridge Intervention:

      A pier supported by brass columns projects out into the non-navigable section of water under Cambie Bridge. The thin sections of the pier lead out to a platform and act as a threshold from one realm into another. On the platform there are benches which have a 30 degree sloping back to encourage lounging on them. When lounging on the benches one faces the smooth monolithic surface of the deck of the bridge, here, light reflected off of the water is projected onto the surface and the caustic reflections hypnotize the eye and stills the mind. Approaching from sea, one passes trough a forest of brass columns and is compressed by the deck of the pier before being released into the space underneath the bridge. A staircase descending into the water allows travelers to moor their vessels and ascend the staircase into a different realm.

###### Project Description:



In this age of constant movement and connectedness, technology and pervasive distraction, moments of stillness are becoming increasingly rare. Stillness of mind and body allow us to put our lives into perspective, position ourselves within the systems we are apart of, and help us to discover what we truly care about. Architecture has the ability to foster stillness through the environments we create and the atmospheres which manifest within them. As a byproduct of urban infrastructure, we have unintentionally created these spaces of stillness under our bridges. Though we are often numb to the atmospheres that surround us, here, the intervention of civic space for us to acknowledge and dwell within these structures, can make their inherent quality of stillness known.
