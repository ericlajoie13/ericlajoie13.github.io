###### Project Description:
In order to serve as a catalyst for a new arts district located on the SE corner of Main St. And Terminal Ave., this project proposes painting several building facades white in order to create an outdoor art gallery. Interesting and beautiful portions of the facade will be intentionally left unpainted in order to draw attention to them and highlight the diverse material pallet that exists in the district. Crowd funding will be employed in order to fund the project and will consist of breaking the facades up into 1 sq.ft increments to be sold separately. During the campaign patrons will have the ability to upload images/gifs that will be projected in real time on the specific section they sponsored on the building facades. This is an opportunity for artists to display their work, but is also an opportunity to witness the unpredictability of online platforms. Portions of the wall that do not receive sponsors by the end of the crowd funding campaign will not be painted white in order to show the implications of crowd funding on the original concept. Once the painting is complete the white surfaces allow artists to show their work in a galley setting that is completely public, serve as the canvas for digital art installations and other projects.
